			<p>
				If you need help with any aspect of Hawkmatix projects, you have many
				options, from reading the manuals, asking for help on the mailing
				lists, or paying for personal support.
			</p>

			<h2>Personal Support</h2>
			<p>
				The Hawkmatix community is a loosely organized association of
				volunteers, so there is a possibility that no one will be available
				to assist you. If the other support options do not satisfy your
				needs, and you feel dedicated support is necessary, you can sign
				up for personal support. With personal support you will have an
				individual assigned to you. He or she will be available around the
				clock via email or phone and will be able to answer any questions
				you may have regarding Hawkmatix projects. If you are interested in
				personal support or would like additional information please email
				<a href="mailto:info@hawkmatix.com">info@hawkmatix.com</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			<p>
				Hawkmatix projects are fully documented by a comprehensive manual
				when published online. PDF versions of the manual are distributed
				along with every copy of the Hawkmatix project source code as well
				as with the compiled versions. To find the proper documentation
				please visit the specific project’s page to download. You can find
				a list of all projects by clicking <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p>
				If you are new to Hawkmatix projects you may have a few questions
				that may have been asked, and answered, a few times before. To
				visit the frequently asked questions page click <a href="faq.html">here</a>.

				If your question isn’t answered in the FAQ or manuals the

				list is a good resource.

			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>
				Intraday Pivots are among the most powerful type of support and
				resistance indicator. They are useful to any style of trader
				that analyzes a security on an intraday basis. These pivots are calculated
				over a period of minute time values and can be changed to any minute value.
				The default time value is set to sixty minutes. For some traders, pivots
				alone are strong enough to base entries and exits upon. The standard pivot
				calculation method has shown the most correlation with price movement. Other
				calculation methods are available as well, which are open included, high weighted,
				low weighted, and close weighted. These pivots have five support levels,
				five resistance levels, and a central pivot, to provide more zones for
				extremely volatile periods. The option to round to the nearest tick is also
				available.

				<b>Risk Disclosure:</b><br>
				All trading contains substantial risks that may not be suitable for every investor.
				An investor could potentially lose all or more than their original investment.
				Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones' financial security or life style.
				Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading.
				Hawkmatix does not recommend the buying or selling of any security and any decision to buy or sell a security is the sole responsibility of the individual.
				Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
				There are no guarantees that trading will result in profit.
				Hawkmatix and all of its contributors are not responsible for any resulting losses.<br>
				<b>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure:</b><br>
				Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below.
				No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
				One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.
				In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading.
				For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results.
				There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

			<h2>NinjaTrader is the industry leader in trade management features!</h2>

				Advanced Trade Management (ATM) is NinjaTrader’s signature order management
				technology that lets you pre-define personal trade management strategies
				including; multiple profit targets and stop-loss orders, one-cancels-other
				(OCO) orders, auto-breakeven stops, trailing stops and much more. This feature
				can significantly enhance trade performance by automatically submitting all
				entry/exit orders within milliseconds! This feature alone tends to cover the
				cost of the platform while simultaneously lowering your stress level by
				eliminating the “deer in the headlights” feeling commonly associated with
				manually managing multiple exit orders in fast-moving markets.

					<li>Easily specify multi-stage exit parameters</li>
					<li>Single check box to create an auto-breakeven stop</li>

				</ul>

				<b>Risk Disclosure:</b><br>
				All trading contains substantial risks that may not be suitable for every investor.
				An investor could potentially lose all or more than their original investment.
				Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones' financial security or life style.
				Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading.
				Hawkmatix does not recommend the buying or selling of any security and any decision to buy or sell a security is the sole responsibility of the individual.
				Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
				There are no guarantees that trading will result in profit.
				Hawkmatix and all of its contributors are not responsible for any resulting losses.<br>
				<b>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure:</b><br>
				Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below.
				No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
				One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.
				In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading.
				For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results.
				There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

				can significantly enhance trade performance by automatically submitting all
				entry/exit orders within milliseconds! This feature alone tends to cover the
				cost of the platform while simultaneously lowering your stress level by
				eliminating the “deer in the headlights” feeling commonly associated with
				manually managing multiple exit orders in fast-moving markets.

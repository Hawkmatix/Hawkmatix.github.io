			<p>
				Hawkmatix is a hub for financial analysis and trading software development.
				We publish projects and reports that cover a wide range of topics including
				trading, finance, mathematics, and computer science. Most projects and
				reports approach problems from a mathematical standpoint and include
				derivations of principles and numerical solutions. All projects are open source,
				freely available, and well documented. We rely on volunteers to research,
				develop, and report findings. Donations are extremely appreciated. Below is
				a bit of additional information about some of our volunteers and history.
			</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				Hawkmatix was originally conceived in the summer of 2012 as a
				developer of high level, mathematically based indicators and
				strategies for use with the NinjaTrader platform. One year
				later the need for a broader, open source approach took over
				and a transition occurred. What Hawkmatix is now is a collaboration
				of multiple volunteers in the mathematics, computer science, and
				business fields, among many others. Our sole purpose is to contribute
				ideas and formulate solutions to projects posed.

			<p>
				Hawkmatix is a hub for financial analysis and trading software development.
				We publish projects and reports that cover a wide range of topics including
				trading, finance, mathematics, and computer science. Most projects and
				reports approach problems from a mathematical standpoint and include
				derivations of principles and numerical solutions. All projects are open source,
				freely available, and well documented. We rely on volunteers to research,
				develop, and report findings. Donations are extremely appreciated. Below is
				a bit of additional information about some of our volunteers and history.
			</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
				Hawkmatix was originally conceived in the summer of 2012 as a
				developer of high level, mathematically based indicators and
				strategies for use with the NinjaTrader platform. One year
				later the need for a broader, open source approach took over
				and a transition occurred. What Hawkmatix is now is a collaboration
				of multiple volunteers in the mathematics, computer science, and
				business fields, among many others. Our sole purpose is to contribute
				ideas and formulate solutions to projects posed.

				<b>Risk Disclosure:</b><br>
				All trading contains substantial risks that may not be suitable for every investor.
				An investor could potentially lose all or more than their original investment.
				Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones' financial security or life style.
				Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading.
				Hawkmatix does not recommend the buying or selling of any security and any decision to buy or sell a security is the sole responsibility of the individual.
				Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
				There are no guarantees that trading will result in profit.
				Hawkmatix and all of its contributors are not responsible for any resulting losses.<br>
				<b>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure:</b><br>
				Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below.
				No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
				One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.
				In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading.
				For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results.
				There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

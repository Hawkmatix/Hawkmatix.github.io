				I am a mathematician specializing in computational science and numerical analysis.
				I graduated from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) with a Bachelor of
				Science degree in Computational Mathematics, concentrating in Computer Science.
				During my time at ERAU, I published a few articles, spoke at mathematics conferences,
				and was awarded scholarships for my research in mathematics. I plan to continue
				my education and pursue a doctoral degree. I love researching new things and
				expanding my mind. A link to my curriculum vitae is on the bottom of this page.
			</p>

				My passion for the financial markets emerged at a young age.
				I remember making profitable stock picks for my mother based upon a simple moving
				average strategy at around twelve years old. Finance isn't the only thing that has
				had my interest. I have been very competitive throughout my entire life.
				When I was twelve I started playing paintball; it quickly emerged into a
				full time thing for me. I would go to school during the day, practice in the
				evening, and either practice more on the weekends or play in a tournament.
				After four years and a couple of championships it was time for me to retire from
				the world of paintball.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After paintball I went on to pursue a dream I had since I was a youngster.
				I wanted to be a Formula One driver. So, like most racing drivers I started
				in karting. I seemed to be a natural at it and went on to win my first championship
				less than a year after starting. Some of the most fun I have had has been at the
				track. Racing gave me the chance to tour all around the United States, and it
				was amazing. Unfortunately, racing is very expensive and it came the time for
				me to choose. I ended up choosing college.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Initially I thought staying in the racing industry would make me the happiest, so
				I started to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. That just made me
				miss racing more and at the time my love for Mathematics was really blossoming.
				One of the best decisions of my life was to switch my major to Computational
				Mathematics. Now that I have graduated, I am very excited to move on to graduate work.

			<h2>Market Insights from the Top of the Pit</h2>
			<p>
				MrTopStep launched in January 2011. Their name is derived from the Chicago
				Board of Trade pits. The most senior member in the “pit” was given the
				distinction of being able to stand at the “top step”.
			</p>

			<p>
				They provide daily live trade flow from the trading floor as well as news
				and market observations from large hedge funds and trading desks around
				the world.  They are centralized in the index markets with their desk 10
				feet from the S&P futures pit. Their insights are direct from the trading
				floor and delivered on a closed instant message platform that has been
				around for more than 15 years; and now <a href="https://mrtopstep.com/impro/" target="_blank">
				MrTopStep’s IMPro</a> is available to the public. Their professional trader’s
				network reaches from coast to coast and extends overseas.
			</p>

			<p>
				MrTopStep’s IMPro collects market flow that translates into trading
				opportunities with specific content in real time on an instant message
				platform. They provide fundamental and technical biases while disseminating
				what they hear, see and feel regarding the markets. They may not hear all the
				news first, but they evaluate the potential market reaction with trading
				objectives while analyzing the risk/reward. They provide enough color and
				order flow to offer numerous trading opportunities. When the markets start
				moving, so does our IM — up or down, we report it throughout the day’s trade
				and help decipher the swings to help make some sense out of it. It is then up
				to you as the trader to pick out what part works for you and what doesn’t as
				you analyze your trades.
			</p>

			<p>
				Their mission is to explain exactly what they are seeing, hearing, and feeling
				and help turn a variety of color into a more tradeable concept.

				<b>Risk Disclosure:</b><br>
				All trading contains substantial risks that may not be suitable for every investor.
				An investor could potentially lose all or more than their original investment.
				Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones' financial security or life style.
				Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading.
				Hawkmatix does not recommend the buying or selling of any security and any decision to buy or sell a security is the sole responsibility of the individual.
				Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
				There are no guarantees that trading will result in profit.
				Hawkmatix and all of its contributors are not responsible for any resulting losses.<br>
				<b>Hypothetical Performance Disclosure:</b><br>
				Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below.
				No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.
				One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.
				In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading.
				For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results.
				There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.

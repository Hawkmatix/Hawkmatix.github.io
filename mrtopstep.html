			<h2>Market Insights from the Top of the Pit</h2>
			<p>
				MrTopStep launched in January 2011. Their name is derived from the Chicago
				Board of Trade pits. The most senior member in the “pit” was given the
				distinction of being able to stand at the “top step”.
			</p>

			<p>
				They provide daily live trade flow from the trading floor as well as news
				and market observations from large hedge funds and trading desks around
				the world.  They are centralized in the index markets with their desk 10
				feet from the S&P futures pit. Their insights are direct from the trading
				floor and delivered on a closed instant message platform that has been
				around for more than 15 years; and now <a href="http://chat.mrtopstep.com/free/" target="_blank">
				MrTopStep’s IMPro</a> is available to the public. Their professional trader’s
				network reaches from coast to coast and extends overseas.
			</p>

			<p>
				MrTopStep’s IMPro collects market flow that translates into trading
				opportunities with specific content in real time on an instant message
				platform. They provide fundamental and technical biases while disseminating
				what they hear, see and feel regarding the markets. They may not hear all the
				news first, but they evaluate the potential market reaction with trading
				objectives while analyzing the risk/reward. They provide enough color and
				order flow to offer numerous trading opportunities. When the markets start
				moving, so does our IM — up or down, we report it throughout the day’s trade
				and help decipher the swings to help make some sense out of it. It is then up
				to you as the trader to pick out what part works for you and what doesn’t as
				you analyze your trades.
			</p>

			<p>
				Their mission is to explain exactly what they are seeing, hearing, and feeling
				and help turn a variety of color into a more tradeable concept.
